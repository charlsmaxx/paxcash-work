## ðŸ“Š **Data Purchase Flow**

### **Same logic applies to data purchases**
- **1st & 2nd**: Full price, no cashback
- **3rd onwards**: 2% cashback
- **Separate tracking** from airtime

---

## ðŸ”„ **Daily Reset**

### **At Midnight (00:00)**
- **Airtime counter**: Resets to 0
- **Data counter**: Resets to 0
- **Combined counter**: Resets to 0
- **All users start fresh** for the new day

---

## ðŸ’° **Revenue Model**

### **How You Make Money**
1. **Transfer fees** - Main revenue source
2. **Airtime/Data margins** - Small profit on each purchase
3. **Cashback costs** - Covered by transfer fees

### **Example Daily Revenue**
```
Transfer Revenue:
- 20 transfers Ã— â‚¦50 average = â‚¦1,000

Airtime/Data Revenue:
- 100 purchases Ã— â‚¦1,000 average = â‚¦100,000
- Small margin per purchase = â‚¦500

Cashback Cost:
- 30 eligible purchases Ã— â‚¦20 average = â‚¦600

Net Revenue: â‚¦1,000 + â‚¦500 - â‚¦600 = â‚¦900
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **User Experience**

### **Frontend Display**
```
Purchase #1: "Make 2 more purchases today to unlock 2% cashback"
Purchase #2: "Make 1 more purchase today to unlock 2% cashback"
Purchase #3: "ðŸŽ‰ You qualify for 2% cashback! â‚¦40 will be credited to your wallet"
Purchase #4: "ðŸŽ‰ You qualify for 2% cashback! â‚¦30 will be credited to your wallet"
```

### **Wallet Updates**

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Tracking**
```javascript
// Transaction metadata
{
  service: 'airtime' | 'data',
  dailyPurchaseCount: 3,
  isEligibleForCashback: true,
  cashbackAmount: 40,
  type: 'cashback'
}
```

### **Daily Reset Logic**
```javascript
// Query for today's purchases
const today = new Date();
today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
const tomorrow = new Date(today);
tomorrow.setDate(tomorrow.getDate() + 1);

// Count purchases between today and tomorrow
const count = await Transaction.countDocuments({
  userId: userId,
  type: 'payment',
  'metadata.service': 'airtime',
  createdAt: { $gte: today, $lt: tomorrow }
});
```
